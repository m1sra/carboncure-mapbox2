      <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
        CarbonCure is a carbon removal technology company that is decarbonizing the global concrete industry.
        </li>
        <li>
        CarbonCure designs and deploys technologies that inject captured CO2 into the concrete-making process, where it is mineralized and permanently stored.
        </li>
        <li>
          This process increases the strength of the concrete, which allows concrete producers to reduce the amount of carbon-intensive cement used in concrete, thereby reducing its emissions.
        </li>
        <li>
        CarbonCureâ€™s technologies are used in over 500 concrete in over 30 countries, turning concrete into a climate solution and accelerating the market for durable CO2 storage by embedding CO2 in thousands of construction projects around the world
