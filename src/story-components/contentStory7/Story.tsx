        Heirloom’s atmospheric CO2 is slated for use in CarbonCure’s X-Prize winning <span className="sub-title">Reclaimed Water</span> technology, currently housed in a Central Plant in downtown San Jose, CA

        <li>
        In North America, around 5% of ready-mix concrete goes unused by customers and is returned to the plant, where it is washed out of concrete trucks and disposed of.
        </li>
        <li>
        To reduce waste and increase efficiency, many concrete plants use reclaimers, a system that enables the separation of this unused concrete into its original aggregates and gray water, both of which can be reused in future concrete mixes.
