      <ul>
        <li>
        In regeneration, calcium carbonate is placed in a renewable-powered kiln that raises the temperature to 900 degrees, decomposing the mineral into calcium oxide and enabling the capture of a high-purity stream of CO2 as a result of calcination.
        </li>
        <li>
        The calcium oxide is then hydrated and spread out on trays in a modular system to maximize its exposure to ambient air, where it undergoes carbonation: it absorbs CO2 and turns back into calcium carbonate.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      The process is then repeated to regularly capture atmospheric CO2 and allow it to be stored permanently.
