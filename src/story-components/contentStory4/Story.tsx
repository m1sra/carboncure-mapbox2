      <ul>
        <li>
        Limestone is made up of Calcium Oxide (CaO) and CO2. When CO2 is removed from the limestone the calcium oxide wants to return to its natural limestone state. It becomes thirsty for CO2 and acts like a sponge, pulling CO2 from the atmosphere.
        </li>
        <li>
        Heirloom heats limestone mineral powder in a renewable-energy powered electric kiln to remove the CO2. The remaining calcium oxide powder is laid onto vertically-stacked trays where well trained algorithms inform Heirloom how to treat the limestone to optimize its ability to uptake CO2. The limestone mineral powder is then looped through Heirloom's process to continuously sponge CO2 from the atmosphere.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Heirloom is currently capturing CO2 at its headquarters in Brisbane, CA with plans to rapidly scale their low cost Direct Air Capture technology to reach their goal of capturing and removing 1 billion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere by 2035.
