      While CarbonCureâ€™s technologies are compatible with CO2 from a wide variety of sources, the company is always seeking opportunities to source atmospheric CO2 as it becomes available.
This is to make sure that the carbon drawdown is happening as quickly as possible, and to make sure that any carbon pulled from the atmosphere is stored permanently, never to be released again
