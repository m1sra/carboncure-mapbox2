        Once there, the concrete, now filled with CO2, will lay the foundation of yet another element of the Bay Area’s built environment, and within hours, the concrete will harden, locking away the atmospheric CO2 for thousands of years

        For the first time in history, DAC CO2 will be permanently stored in concrete
