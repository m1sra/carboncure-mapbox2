        Atmospheric CO2 concentration is currently at 419ppm relative to 280ppm concentration in a pre-industrial period. This overconcentration of CO2 is the primary driver of global warming that has been wreaking havoc on the planet in the form of extreme weather events and radically shifting environments. According to the IPCC, any realistic scenario of humanity avoiding the most catastrophic outcomes of climate change will require both continued emission reductions as well as a significant ramp up of carbon dioxide removal paired with permanent storage.

      Two carbon removal technology companies, <a href="https://www.heirloomcarbon.com/" target="_blank" className="important">Heirloom Carbon</a> and <a href="https://www.carboncure.com/" target="_blank" className="important">CarbonCure Technologies</a>, partnered with <a href="https://www.centralconcrete.com/" target="_blank" className="important">Central Concrete</a> in early 2023 to achieve a significant milestone that leverages the gigaton-scale potential of their respective technologies: the first-ever permanent storage of carbon dioxide from direct air capture in concrete. This story outlines that project and its impact.
