        With CarbonCure’s Reclaimed Water technology, captured CO2 is injected into the reclaimed water slurry– <span className="sub-title">the mixture of water and unused concrete</span>– where it achieves three things: it binds to and separates out cementitious materials, improves consistency of predictability of the reclaimed water solids, and increases the amount of materials that can be reused.
        </li>
        <li>
        These materials can then be pumped directly into the concrete mixer or set aside for future use.
